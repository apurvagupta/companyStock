Stock Order Execution System!
Problem: A stock order is an order to buy/sell a given
quantity of stocks of specified company. Person willing to
buy or sell a stock will submit an order to a stock exchange,
where it is executed against the opposite side order of
same company i.e, buy order is executed against an
existing sell order and vice-versa. The criteria for stock
orders execution is that, they should belong to same
company, they are opposite sides ( Buy vs Sell), and order
of arrival i.e, the order is executed against the first available
order. The left over quantity after execution is called
remaining quantity. For example, if a buy order of quantity
10 is executed against a sell order of quantity 5, the
remaining quantity of buy and sell orders are 5 and 0
respectively. An order status is called OPEN if the
remaining quantity is greater than zero(>0), otherwise itâ€™s
called CLOSED(i.e., remaining quantity = 0). Your task is to
implement stock order execution system which takes input
orders from given CSV (SOES - Input.csv), processes them
and prints the status, remaining quantity of all the orders as
output. Sample output is attached.
